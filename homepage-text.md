## DEAR USERS OF THE INTERNET,

In January 2012 we defeated the SOPA and PIPA censorship legislation with the largest Internet protest in history. A year ago this month one of that movement's leaders, Aaron Swartz, tragically passed away.

Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet, and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society: mass surveillance.

If Aaron were alive, he'd be on the front lines, fighting against a world in which governments observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.

Now, on the anniversary of Aaron's passing, and in celebration of the win against SOPA and PIPA that he helped make possible, we are planning a day of protest against mass surveillance, to take place **this February 11th**.


## WHAT WE'LL DO ON FEBRUARY 11th:

**If you're in the US**: Thousands of websites will host banners urging people to call/email Congress. Plans may change, but we intend to ask legislators to oppose the FISA Improvements Act, support the USA Freedom Act, and enact protections for non-Americans.

**If you're not in the US**: Visitors will be asked to urge appropriate targets to institute privacy protections


## TAKE PART: THIS IS YOUR MOMENT

The SOPA and PIPA protests were successful because we all took part, as a community. **As Aaron put it, everybody "made themselves the hero of their own story."** We can set a date, but we need all of you, the users of the Internet, to make it a movement.
