# The Day We Fight Back needs your help

[Thedaywefightback.org](https://thedaywefightback.org) is the central hub website for an online protest against mass surveillance on February 11th, 2014. The site was built by [Taskforce.is](http://taskforce.is), a group of volunteers who build activism tools for online advocacy.

The site is open source, and given that we are resource limited, we can use all the help we can get. Giving enthusiastic participants resources, tools and a central place to organize is critical if the day of action is going to be a success.

## Submit and explore ideas

You can submit and read about projects that would improve the site in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tfrce/thedaywefightback/issues?state=open).

Once an idea has been fleshed out and has interest from a group of people who want to work on it, we can create a repository and assign an initial core team to build it (it can be a fork of the existing site). That team will have full control over how the project is executed.

Everyone else is free to submit pull requests to the project's repository and the core team can request that helpful contributors be added to the team.
